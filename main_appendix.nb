# Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to store supplementary material for the article 'Visualising and quantifying 'excess deaths' in Scotland compared with the rest of the UK and the rest of Western Europe'. Supplementary material includes both web appendices for explaining some of the methods and procedures used in more detail than the word limit of the article allows; and also supplementary results which complement those presented in the paper, and illustrate some of the broader potential applications of the methods used in the paper to other forms of health data comparison.
